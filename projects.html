			<h2>For our EE senior design at USF, our team of 4 decided to build an automated interior wall painting robot. Our dream was to have a machine that would be able to precisely cover a flat wall with paint much quicker than an average human painter while managing to paint around wall outlets and other small obstacles. As with all underfunded projects in life, compromises were made. But we were all excited to be working with paint!</h2>

My team decided to work on how the communication between students and staff at dining halls could be improved. This would help students produce less waste and they would be able to convey their problems that led them to produce waste in the first place.</h2>
